### **Roles in Oracle Cloud HCM**
1. **Job Roles**:
   - Predefined roles provided by Oracle, designed for specific job functions.
   - Example: A Payroll Manager has access to payroll processing tasks, while a Benefits Specialist manages employee benefits.
   - Roles group tasks and data access permissions, making role assignment easier.

2. **Abstract Roles**:
   - These roles are general and not tied to specific duties.
   - Common examples include "Employee" or "Line Manager," granting basic access like viewing payslips or approving leave requests.
   - Abstract roles ensure that all employees or specific groups have standardized permissions.

3. **Duty Roles**:
   - Represent a detailed set of privileges for a specific task within the system.
   - Example: A Payroll Manager's duty roles might include "Process Payroll Duty" and "View Payroll Reports Duty."
   - Duty roles form the building blocks of job roles.

4. **Data Roles**:
   -Data roles are a combination of a job role and a data security policy.
   -They define what data a user can access and what actions they can perform on that data.
   -For example, a "Payroll Manager" job role combined with a data role might allow access to payroll data for a specific business unit or department.

5.  **Custom Roles**:
   - When predefined roles don't meet specific business needs, custom roles are created.
   - Using the Security Console, admins can define custom roles by combining job roles and duty roles.
   - This ensures flexibility while maintaining system security.

### **Role Mapping & Provisioning**
- **Role Mapping**:
   - This is the process of aligning predefined or custom roles with users or their responsibilities.
   - Example: When an employee becomes a Line Manager, the "Line Manager" abstract role is assigned automatically, granting them the ability to view and approve direct reports' requests.

- **Role Provisioning**:
   - Automated assignment of roles based on rules.
   - Example: When a new employee is hired, they automatically receive the "Employee" role, providing them with access to basic HR functions like updating personal details.

### **Suspension, De-provisioning, and Reactivation**
1. **Suspension**:
   - Temporarily disables a user account, preserving their roles without removing them.
   - Used when employees go on leave or during security investigations.

2. **De-provisioning**:
   - Removes access to roles permanently, often done when employees leave the organization.
   - Ensures they no longer have access to sensitive data.

3. **Reactivation**:
   - Restores access to roles for users who were suspended but return to active status.
   - Example: Reinstating access for an employee returning from extended leave.

### **Person User, Party User, and Contingent Worker**
- **Person User**: Employees who are given system access to perform tasks like updating profiles or requesting leave.
- **Party User**: External users, such as suppliers or third-party contractors, often associated with business interactions.
- **Contingent Worker**: Non-permanent staff like freelancers or consultants who have limited access to HCM modules.

### **Core HR**
1. **Manage Geography**:
   - Defines locations (countries, regions, states) to ensure compliance with local regulations and reporting.

2. **Manage Locations**:
   - Physical or virtual locations where employees work. These are linked to legal employers.

3. **Manage Legal Authority**:
   - Entities like government bodies or regulatory authorities under which the company operates.

4. **Address Style Formatting**:
   - Ensures that addresses are stored in formats compliant with local standards.

5. **Enterprise Structure Configurator**:
   - A tool to design an organization's structure, including divisions, business units, and departments.

6. **Position Synchronization**:
   - Automatically updates job attributes (department, grade, location) when a position is updated.

7. **Reference Data Sets**:
   - Allows sharing of master data (e.g., pay grades) across business units while keeping other data exclusive.

8. **Person Number**:
   - Can be generated automatically, entered manually during hiring, or loaded in bulk using tools like HDL.

9. **Assignment Number**:
   - A system-generated identifier unique to each role or job assignment an employee holds.

### **Grades and Workforce Structures**
1. **Grades**:
   - Represents pay levels or job levels within the organization.
   - **Grade Steps**: Define increments within a grade.
   - **Grade Rates**: Specify pay ranges or amounts.
   - **Grade Step Progression**: Automated promotion mechanism.

2. **Positions**:
   - Single Incumbent: One person per position (e.g., CEO).
   - Pooled Incumbent: Multiple individuals in the same role (e.g., customer service representatives).
   - Shared Incumbent: The same position is shared by multiple employees (rare but possible).

- **General Ledger**: Core financial module for managing accounting transactions and financial reporting.
- **Accounts Payable**: Manages vendor payments, ensuring invoices are paid on time.
- **Accounts Receivable**: Tracks customer payments and revenue collection.
- **Cash Management**: Reconciles bank accounts and monitors cash flow.

### **HDL and HSDL**
- **HDL**:
   - Ideal for importing bulk employee, location, or assignment data.
   - Works with preformatted CSV files containing data mapped to HCM tables.

- **HSDL**:
   - A spreadsheet-based tool for uploading or updating employee information.
   - Easier to use and requires minimal technical knowledge.

### **Flexfields & Lookups**
- **Flexfields**:
   - Configurable fields allowing customization:
     - **Key Flexfields (KFF)**: Structured data like locations or job hierarchies.
     - **Descriptive Flexfields (DFF)**: Additional attributes for specific use cases.
     - **Extensible Flexfields (EFF)**: Enhance predefined data structures with custom attributes.

- **Lookups**:
   - Helps standardize input values for dropdowns (e.g., Yes/No).
   - Includes static values or dynamic, table-driven lists for validation.
