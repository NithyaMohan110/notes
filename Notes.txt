Security Framework:
Privileges
duty role(hire terminate)
job role(hr specialist)
employee



run user and role syncronization process(if any role is created and the status is in waiting then we can use this)
when we create data role we need to select job role

function security policy is used to remove privileges

S&M task search manage organisation security profile(if we want to give custom instead of view all org)

implementation project: it is a group of modules or projects

primary 
Division
BU
Depts

LDG is created for every divison(country) for payroll and ledger

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we create LE , Registration unit and reporting unit are automatically created.

Payroll Santutary Unit(PSU)

Job set
job
grade
department
grade set

Jobs- USed Service industries
Position Used by industries that maintain headcount

Bench mark - Other jobs and reports and salary
Progression - next job in grade ladder

Manage jobs lo velli we can group jobs

-----------------------------------------------------------
Lookups are values provided by oracle
three types
standard/system- cannot modify
extension- add new items but cant delete items
user- can do both

----------------------------------------------------------------
Position Lookups are 5


if we want to create positions, depts and jobs are mandatory
Grade: used to define level of compensation

Position types are of 3 types:
single incumbent- only one position
shared- multiple employees can take based on shifts
pooled- multiple ppl in the same roll intern is an ex
-------------------------------------------------------------

Grade-
Grade rate
Grade steps
grade ladder

grouping grades into ladders- Grade Ladder/Sequence of grades

Ceiling steps: if we give this to 3rd step then till third step it is mandatory then it is optional.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Person Management - we can find employee details here
HR Specialist- 
Directory

Manage Approval Tansactions for HCM:
(indhulo Position trees ni use chestham)
Rules:

If admin wants to check the emp details hired by the functional consultant , then he can put that rule
Manage Approval Tansactions for HCM -> set rules

Bypass approvals:
if we want to process a transaction without any approval process , then we should enable bypass approvals

Manage Approval groups:
Static - Members are manually assigned and remain fixed until explicitly changed by an administrator.
Dynamic - Members are automatically assigned based on predefined criteria such as roles, departments, geographic locations, or other attributes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roles:
Job roles: group of duty roles
It is a generic role. It is a job that the worker is hired to do.

Run payroll view pay slips(duty roles assigned to job role)

Data role: Job role+ security profile(to restrict the data)

Abstract role: Define a worker's role in the enterprise irrespective of the job. Every worker will atleast one abstract role in which he
 will work on standard funtions

process:
