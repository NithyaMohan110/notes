 GEOGRAPHIES
-----------
Geography is a physical space on Earth, such as a location or region, that's defined by a boundary.
In Oracle HCM (Human Capital Management), **geographies** are used to define and manage location-based data,
 such as countries, states, cities, and postal codes. These geographies are essential for tasks
 like payroll, tax calculations, and employee management, as they ensure accurate and consistent 
handling of location-specific information.

---

### **Key Components of Geographies in HCM**:
1. **Geography Structure**:
   - Defines the hierarchy of geography types (e.g., Country > State > City > Postal Code).
   - Determines how geographies are related within a country or region.

2. **Geography Hierarchy**:
   - Represents the actual geographies (e.g., United States > California > Los Angeles).
   - Used for organizing and validating location data.

3. **Geography Validation**:
   - Ensures that addresses entered in the system are valid and conform to the defined geography structure.
   - Helps in tasks like tax validation and address formatting.

---

### **Steps to Create Geographies in HCM**:
1. **Access the Setup and Maintenance Work Area**:
   - Navigate to the **Setup and Maintenance** section in Oracle HCM.

2. **Define Geography Structure**:
   - Go to the **Manage Geographies** task.
   - Define the geography types (e.g., Country, State, City) and their hierarchical relationships.
   - Example: For the United States, you might define `State` as the highest level, followed by `City`
 and `Postal Code`.

3. **Create Geography Hierarchy**:
   - Use the **Geography Hierarchies** task to add geographies for each geography type.
   - Example: Add `California` under `United States` as a `State`, and then add `Los Angeles` under
 `California` as a `City`.

4. **Set Up Geography Validation**:
   - Map geography types to address attributes (e.g., `State` to `Region`, `City` to `Locality`).
   - Specify validation levels (e.g., error or warning) for incorrect geographies.

5. **Import Geographies (Optional)**:
   - If you have a large number of geographies, you can import them using a CSV or XML file through the
 **Import Management** tool.

6. **Activate the Geography Hierarchy**:
   - Once the hierarchy is created, activate it to make it available for use in the system.

---

### **Example**:
For the United States:
- **Geography Structure**: Country > State > City > Postal Code.
- **Geography Hierarchy**:
  - Country: United States
  - State: California
  - City: Los Angeles
  - Postal Code: 90001

### **Types of Roles in Oracle HCM**

In Oracle HCM, **roles** are a critical part of the security framework, determining what users can access and the actions they can perform within the system. Roles are assigned to users and are linked to specific permissions and privileges. Below is a detailed explanation of the various types of roles:

---

### **1. Abstract Roles**
- **Definition**:
  Abstract roles are generic roles assigned to users based on their responsibilities within the organization, irrespective of their specific job functions or departments.
- **Purpose**:
  These roles provide common privileges that apply to broad groups of users, like employees and managers.
- **Examples**:
  - Employee
  - Line Manager
  - Contingent Worker
- **Usage**:
  For example, the "Employee" role grants access to tasks like viewing personal details, applying for leave, and submitting expense reports.

---

### **2. Job Roles**
- **Definition**:
  Job roles represent specific job functions or duties that an individual performs in the organization. They are more task-oriented and tailored to a specific role in a business process.
- **Purpose**:
  These roles allow access to modules and tasks required for a specific job.
- **Examples**:
  - HR Specialist
  - Payroll Manager
  - Benefits Administrator
- **Usage**:
  For instance, an HR Specialist role allows access to modules like employee records, workforce structures, and recruitment.

---

### **3. Data Roles**
- **Definition**:
  Data roles combine job roles with data security policies. They limit the scope of data that a user can access based on specific criteria, such as location, department, or legal entity.
- **Purpose**:
  These roles ensure that users only access data relevant to their assigned responsibilities.
- **Examples**:
  - HR Specialist – United States
  - Payroll Administrator – Europe
- **Usage**:
  An HR Specialist with a data role for the United States can only view employee records within that territory.

---

### **4. Duty Roles**
- **Definition**:
  Duty roles are granular roles that represent a collection of privileges required to complete a specific task. These roles are used as building blocks for job and data roles.
- **Purpose**:
  They define actions or functions within the system, like editing a record or running a report.
- **Examples**:
  - Edit Job
  - Submit Payroll
  - Create Employee Record
- **Usage**:
  Duty roles are not assigned directly to users but are inherited through job roles.

---

### **5. Functional Roles**
- **Definition**:
  Functional roles provide specific permissions to access and manage particular functional areas within Oracle HCM.
- **Purpose**:
  They ensure users can carry out actions such as configuration or maintenance for certain modules.

- **Purpose**:
  They are used to assemble duty roles and are indirectly associated with users through higher-level roles.
- **Examples**:
  - View Employee Record
  - Edit Department Details

---

### **7. Inherited Roles**
- **Definition**:
  Inherited roles are roles that users automatically receive based on their existing role assignments. This reduces redundancy in role assignments.
- **Purpose**:
  It allows cascading privileges based on role hierarchies.
- **Examples**:
  - An "Employee" role automatically inherits privileges related to "Contingent Worker" if both apply.

Here’s a detailed explanation and step-by-step process for all the requested topics in Oracle HCM:

---

### **1. Types of Roles and Managing Them**
**Theory**:
Roles in Oracle HCM define the actions users can perform and the data they can access. There are four main types of roles:
1. **Aggregate Privileges**:
   - Bundles of function and data security privileges.
   - Example: "View Person Management Aggregate Privilege."
2. **Abstract Roles**:
   - High-level roles for common user types (e.g., Employee, Contingent Worker, Line Manager).
   - Focus on tasks like viewing personal details or managing direct reports.
3. **Job Roles**:
   - Tailored to specific responsibilities or functions within the organization (e.g., HR Specialist, Payroll Manager).
   - Includes inherited privileges from duty roles.
4. **Duty Roles**:
   - Contain granular privileges, representing tasks that can be performed (e.g., Create Job, Edit Assignment).
   - Duty roles are not directly assigned to users but are part of job roles.

**Steps to Manage Roles**:
1. Navigate to **Security Console** in Oracle HCM.
2. Use the **Roles Tab** to:
   - View existing roles.
   - Analyze role hierarchies (showing inherited privileges and sub-roles).
3. Modify roles by adding or removing privileges as needed.
4. Save and deploy changes.
