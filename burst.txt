Reporting:
Two kinds of Database:
One for Online Data Entry: Goal is to make Data Entry Faster. 5 years of data.
One for Data Warehouse: Data that does not updated will be stored.
 All historic data will be stored in different structure.

Four types of reports:
BI Publisher (Online Database)
OTBI (Online Database)
FRS â€“ Financial Reporting Solution (Data Warehouse)
SmartView (Data Warehouse)

Steps involved in Reporting:
Gather the data(xml format)
To format the data(how we want to present it to the clients)
Distribute the data (send it to desired location)

BI publisher will perform above steps independently.
There is 1-many-many relationship.

==============================================================================

Distribution: 
For distribution we should perform Splitting and Delivering the report.
Every Split will be delivered to the user. 
Reason to split is, every receiver should receive only desired data.
Splitting in BI Publisher means Bursting.
Splitting is based on Key Column. Every Split should contain only one
Deliverable Key (Highest Level).

Bursting in BI Publisher is a process where data is split into blocks,
and documents are generated for each block before being delivered to
different destinations. The splitting is governed by a "Split By" element,
while the delivery method is determined by a "Deliver By" element. 
This allows for customized formatting and delivery options for each 
segment of the report.

In OTBI, bursting is used to divide large datasets into multiple smaller 
datasets. The logic for bursting ensures that reports are split into chunks,
but there can be challenges, such as compressed output being placed into 
multiple zip folders incorrectly

The key difference is that BI Publisher provides more control over
formatting and delivery options, while OTBI focuses on breaking large 
datasets into manageable parts for reporting.

===============================================

BI Publisher Bursting Process
Data Extraction: A query is executed to retrieve the full dataset.

Splitting Data: The data is divided into blocks based on a "Split By" element 
(e.g., CUSTOMER_ID for invoices).

Delivery Definition: A "Deliver By" element determines how each report is 
formatted and delivered.

Report Generation: A separate document is created for each split segment.

Delivery: Reports are sent to different destinations
 (email, printer, FTP, etc.) based on predefined rules

================================================

OTBI Bursting Process
Data Extraction: A report is generated with all required data.

Splitting Data: The report is divided into smaller datasets using agents.

Delivery: The agent ensures that each recipient receives only the relevant
portion of the report

The key difference is that BI Publisher provides more control over
formatting and delivery options,while OTBI uses agents to distribute 
reports efficiently.

============================================================================

Scheduling:

Scheduling in BI Publisher and OTBI allows users to automate report 
generation and delivery at specified times.

BI Publisher Scheduling:
Report Scheduling: Users can schedule reports to run at specific intervals 
(daily, weekly, monthly).

Delivery Options: Reports can be sent via email, FTP, printer, or web 
folders.

Parameter Customization: Users can define parameters for scheduled reports.

Job Monitoring: Scheduled jobs can be tracked and managed.

============================================

OTBI Scheduling:
Agent-Based Scheduling: OTBI uses agents to automate report execution.

Conditional Execution: Reports can be triggered based on conditions.

Data Refresh: Scheduled reports ensure updated data is available.

Delivery Methods: Reports can be sent via email or dashboards.



=============================================================================

Payroll Elements:
Two types:
Deduction Element
Earning Element

elements are also categorized as 
recurring
non recurring

processed along with salary
not processed along with salary
